# WorldWideTranslation
Project Overview:
We developed a web application for a group of professionals to promote their services to their customers. Our website is a translating website. The proposed content of our website will contain a list of professional translators, alongside the ratings and comments of the users who were serviced by the corresponding translator, and a search bar to filter translators offering their translation services from a certain language to a particular language.
List of Categories:
- Two types of users: Translators and Customers in need for translation services for their documents.
- There will be a combination of different languages that the customers can filter the translators from.
- Payment Form.
- Find Translators.
- Translatorâ€™s profile.
- Become a Translator
- Login / Sign up.
- My translations.
- About us.
